            Hi I'm Maura - I'm 24 years old. I was born in Philadelphia and grew up playing soccer starting from the age
            of four
            and played all through out college at Capital Univeristy in Columbus, OH. I studied Communications with an
            emphasis in Public Relations and soon after graduating in 2016 learned that this was not the career for me.
            I wish I would have figured that out in college.
        </p>
        <p>
            After moving home from Columbus, I started self teaching myself how to code while looking for a job as a way
            to gain some more skills
            and then realized that I liked it enough to possibly make a career out of it. Currently,I work in
            fundraising at a
            local university, but am looking to make a career change into the tech field. Outside of coding, my hobbies
            include:
            <ul>
                <li>reading - last year I read 52 books in 52 weeks</li>
                <li>learning new languages - I am almost fluent in Spanish and I'm learning Italian</li>
                <li>travelling - I want to travel to all 50 states before I turn 50</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            If anyone has any book recommendations, please send them my way - or if you're in need of some, let me know
            I love sharing my favorite reads with people. I also just got back into playing Pok&#233;monGo so if anyone
            wants to be friends
            on that - dm me on slack!
